inode-api (multi-tenant)
===================

We are glad to share with you this awesome boilerplate for build an API multi-tenant with Node.js and RethinkDB. It include some basic features like:

 - **Authentication** 
 - **User CRUD**
 - **Tenant CRUD**
 - **ACL**

----------


Getting Started
-------------

You have to create a rethinkDb and edit the .env and corresponding config/enviroments file.

Next that you can start the application running index.js file
